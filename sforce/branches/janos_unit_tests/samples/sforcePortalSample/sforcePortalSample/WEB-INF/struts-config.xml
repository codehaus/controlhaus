     This is the Struts configuration file for the example application,
     using the proposed new syntax.

     NOTE:  You would only flesh out the details in the "form-bean"
     declarations if you had a generator tool that used them to create
     the corresponding Java classes for you.  Otherwise, you would
     need only the "form-bean" element itself, with the corresponding
     "name" and "type" attributes.
