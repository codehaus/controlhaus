<h2>Using the Amazon Book Lookup Control</h2>
The Amazon Control API is as follows:<br>
<pre>public ProductInfo lookupBook(String isbn)</pre>
This returns an XML Bean containing information about the book
identified by the supplied <a href="http://www.isbn.org/">ISBN</a>.&nbsp;
If the control is unable to perform the operation it will throw a <a
 href="http://edocs.bea.com/workshop/docs81/doc/en/workshop/java-class/weblogic/jws/control/ControlException.html">ControlException</a>.&nbsp;
The next section describes how to navigate the ProductInfo XML Bean.<br>

<br>
ProductInfo may contain an ErrorMsg.&nbsp; If this element is present,
the book lookup did not succeed, and the error message should be logged
to the client.<br>
<br>
If the book lookup succeeded, there will be a Details object that
contains data about the book.&nbsp; The meaning of the fields in the
Details object should be clear from their names, however, some require
comment.&nbsp; "Asin" is the ISBN for the book.&nbsp; ProductName is
the title of the book.&nbsp; The image URLs are absolute URLs to images
on the Amazon servers of the cover of the book.<br>
<br>
<h3>Amazon Terms and Conditions</h3>
Amazon has clearly defined terms and conditions governing the use of
their web service apis.&nbsp; The Amazon Book Lookup control does not enforce these terms, so it is
up to you, the user of the control, to ensure that the terms are met.<br>
