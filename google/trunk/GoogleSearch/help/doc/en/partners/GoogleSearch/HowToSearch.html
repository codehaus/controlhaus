<h2>Search the web using the Google Search Control</h2>
        Before you can use  the Google Web APIs, you need to register with
 Google    and obtain a Google  Key.  You need to configure the Google Control
 with   this key, as described  in the section on <a
 href="HowToConfigure.html">configuring    the Google Control</a>.<br>
        <br>
        The Google Control provides two methods to perform an internet search.
    The first is a simple method that takes as parameters the query string
 and  an index into the search results.  The second accepts a more complete
 parameter   list and allows more control over the search operation.  Both
 methods are   detailed below.<br>
        <br>
               
<h3>Simple search method</h3>
        The simple search method is invoked as follows:<br>
              
<pre>String query = "Weblogic Workshop"<br>int start = 0;<br>GoogleSearchResult var = control.googleSearch( query, start);<br></pre>
   This will return ten results for the query "Weblogic Workshop", starting 
at result element 0. &nbsp;The behaviour of this method can be tweaked by
configuring some or all of the properties provided by the control, documented
<a href="HowToConfigure.html">here</a>.<br>
 <br>
 
<h3>Extended search method</h3>
 The extended search method is invoked as follows:<br>
 
<pre>String query = "Weblogic Workshop"<br>int start = 0;<br>int maxResults = 10;<br>boolean filter = true;<br>String restrict = "<font
 size="-2">countryUS</font>";<br>boolean safeSearch = true;<br>String languageRestrict = "<font
 size="-1">lang_en</font>";<br>GoogleSearchResult var = control.googleSearchExtended( query, <br>                                                       start,<br>                                                       maxResults,<br>                                                       filter,<br>                                                       restrict,<br>                                                       safeSearch,<br>                                                       languageRestrict);</pre>
 <br>
 This will return ten results for the query "Weblogic Workshop", starting 
at result element, from web sites hosted in the US and whose content is in 
the English language. &nbsp;Additionally the results will be filtered for
adult content and duplicates.<br>
<h3>Using the results from the Google Search Control</h3>
The GoogleSearchResult type returned by the search methods contains both
data associated with the search itself, and data associated with each match.
&nbsp;The data associated with the search itself include items like total
search time, the query used, the total number of possible matches etc. &nbsp;The
data associated with each match is retrieved as follows:<br>
<br>
<pre>GoogleSearchResult var = control.googleSearch( query, start);<br>ResultElement[] matches = var.resultElements;<br></pre>
 The ResultElement type contains fields like a summary of the matches page,
the URL to that page, the title of the match and a snippet of content etc.
