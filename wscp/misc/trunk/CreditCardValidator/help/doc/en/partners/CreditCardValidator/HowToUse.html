<h2>Using the CreditCard Validator Control</h2>
The CreditCard Control provides a single method for credit card
validation. The
essential parameter(s) to this method are shown below. The java
interface for the control is below:<br>
<pre>Collection validate(java.lang.String number, java.util.Date expiryDate, com.bea.powertoys.creditcard.CardType type);<br>
</pre>
<h3>Invoking the control<br>
</h3>
The credit card validator method is invoked as follows:<br>
<pre>String number = "5334 5678 1234 5670";<br><b>GregorianCalendar calender = new </b><b>GregorianCalendar(2010,4,20);<br></b>Date expiryDate = calender.getTime();<br>CardType cardType = CardType.MASTER_CARD;<br><br>Collection result = control.validate(number,expiryDate,cardType);<br></pre>
Please note all the three arguments provided to the control are
mandatory and credit card number may have spaces.<br>
<br>
<h3>Using the result</h3>
Control returns a collection of
'com.bea.powertoys.creditcard.CreditCardError' objects. Empty
collection means the credit card is valid, on the other hand non-empty
collections means errors. For every error, the collection contains an
immutable obejct of type
'com.bea.powertoys.creditcard.CreditCardError'. Errors in collection
may be among the following:<br>
<pre>public static final CreditCardError NUMBER_INVALID;<br>public static final CreditCardError EXPIRED;<br>public static final CreditCardError INVALID_TYPE;</pre>
<h4>Invalid Credit Card<br>
</h4>
NUMBER_INVALID : Denotes that the credit card number provided has
failed to pass Luhn Formula as described <a
 href="http://perl.about.com/cs/intermediateperl/a/111303.htm">here</a>.<br>
EXPIRED : Denotes that the credit card expiry date has been expired.<br>
INVALID_TYPE : Denotes that credit card type is not-valid for the
credit card number provided.<br>
<br>
<h4>Valid Credit Card</h4>
When the returned collection is empty, it denotes that the credit card
information provided to the control is valid&nbsp; with respect to
three tests performed.<br>
<br>
The Java Page Flow sample that accompanies the CreditCard Control
demonstrates
how to use the control.<br>
