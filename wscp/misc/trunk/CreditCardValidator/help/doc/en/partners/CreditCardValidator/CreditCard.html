<h2>CreditCard Validator PowerToy</h2>
<p>This documentation contains instruction on how to:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="HowToUse.html">Use the CreditCard Validator Control</a>
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The CreditCard control is based on two principles on which credit
cards adhere to, i.e. Luhn formula (or Luhn algorithm or mod 10
algorithm) and specific type of credit card has specific prefix and/or
length. You can find more information about these principles <a
 href="http://perl.about.com/cs/intermediateperl/a/111303.htm">here</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>Credit Card Validator control <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span>
checks for three things, mentioned
below:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Credit Card number is valid.</li>
  <li>Credit Card is not expired.</li>
  <li>Credit Card type is valid for the credit card number provided.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Important Note : <br>
</h4>
Passing the Luhn formula is only the first step. Matching specific card
criteria is the second. However, running a number through a credit card
server is the only real test, because that's when the validity of the
credit card account is actually verified.<br>
<br>
This control <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">only</span>
perform checks to make sure the number is well formed, not expired and
credit card type is valid.
