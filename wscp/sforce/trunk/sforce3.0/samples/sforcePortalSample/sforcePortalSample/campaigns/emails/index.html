        <p>This directory should contain WebLogic Portal campaign email files.</p>
        <p>Any files underneath this directory are available to the campaign
        services for generating emails to send to users. By default, they are
        not accessible externally, controlled via security constraints in
        /WEB-INF/web.xml. This is to prevent external, uncontrolled access to
        potentially private and personalized email content.</p>
