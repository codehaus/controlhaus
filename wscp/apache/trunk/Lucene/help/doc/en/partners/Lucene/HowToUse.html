<h2>Using the Lucene Control</h2>
The Lucene Control provides two methods: one to put data into the
Lucene search index, and another to execute queries on the index.&nbsp;
<br>
<h3>Indexing Data</h3>
The operation to index data is as follows:<br>
<pre>public void index(LuceneField []fields)</pre>
where LuceneField is a name/value pair, as follows:<br>
<pre>public class LuceneField {</pre>
<pre>	public LuceneField(String name, String value){...}</pre>
<pre>	public String getName(){...}</pre>
<pre>	public String getValue(){...}</pre>
<pre>}</pre>
The array of LuceneFields passed to the index operation are considered
to belong to the same "document".&nbsp; What this means is that a query
on any field will make available the entire array of fields that were
indexed with that field.&nbsp; An example should help to make it
clear.&nbsp; Imagine you are indexing an email message.<br>
<br>
<pre>EmailMessage email = ...</pre>
<pre>LuceneField fromField = new LuceneField("from", email.getFrom());</pre>
<pre>LuceneField toField = new LuceneField("to", email.getTo());</pre>
<pre>LuceneField subjectField = new LuceneField("subject", email.getSubject());</pre>
<pre>luceneControl.index(new LuceneField[]{fromField, toField, subjectField});</pre>
<br>
Now fromField, toField and subjectField are considered to belong to the
same "document".&nbsp; If you (later) execute a query on the fromField,
for example, the toField and the subjectField will also be available to
you in the query result, thereby enabling you to reconstitute the
entire document.<br>
<h3>Searching Data</h3>
<br>
The operation to search data is as follows:<br>
<br>
<pre>public LuceneHit[] search(String query, String searchFieldName, String[] returnFieldNames)</pre>
The query is a plain query as you would enter into any search
engine.&nbsp; The searchFieldName is the name of the field you want to
query on.&nbsp; For example, "subject" is a possibility using the email
example above.&nbsp; returnFieldNames is an array of names of
LuceneFields that you want returned.&nbsp; You may, for example, use
"from" and "to" using the email example above.&nbsp; LuceneHit is as
follows:<br>
<pre>public class LuceneHit {</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public Map getFields(){...}</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public float getScore(){...}</pre>
<pre>}</pre>
The score is a measure of how good a metch the Hit is.&nbsp; Its a
value ranging from 0 to 1, with 1 being a perfect match.&nbsp;
getFields() returns a Map containing LuceneField instanced keyed by
name.&nbsp; This map will contain the LuceneFields you asked to have
returned by specifying their names in the returnFieldNames string array
in the search operation.&nbsp; It is best explained by way of example:<br>
<br>
<pre>LuceneHit []hits = luceneControl.search("tom@acme.com", "from", new String[]{"from","to","subject"});</pre>
<pre>System.out.println("The number of emails from tom@acme.com is " + hits.length);</pre>
<pre>LuceneHit firstHit = hits[0];</pre>
<pre>System.out.println("Here is the content of the first email in the result list:");</pre>
<pre>System.out.println("from: " + ((LuceneField)firstHit.getFields().get("from")).getValue());</pre>
<pre>System.out.println("to: " + ((LuceneField)firstHit.getFields().get("to")).getValue());</pre>
<pre>System.out.println("subject: " + ((LuceneField)firstHit.getFields().get("subject")).getValue());</pre>
</body>
